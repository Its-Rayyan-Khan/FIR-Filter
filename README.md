Design Implementation of High-Performance FIR Filter Using Low-Power Multiplier and Adder


This work describes the design and implementation of a high-performance Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filter that uses low-power multipliers and adders to process digital signals efficiently. FIR filters
are widely utilised in a variety of applications that require high performance and power efficiency,
including audio and picture processing, telecommunications, and embedded systems. In this paper,
we provide a unique architecture that incorporates low-power, high-speed multipliers and adders to
improve the overall efficiency of the FIR filter. To reduce power consumption, the multiplier uses
techniques such as clock gating and voltage scaling, whilst the adder design uses carry-lookahead and
other advanced techniques to optimise speed and reduce latency. The proposed FIR filter is assessed
in terms of power consumption, latency, and area, and it outperforms existing designs significantly.
Simulation findings show that the suggested architecture reduces power consumption significantly
while maintaining high throughput and little latency, making it appropriate for power-constrained
applications. The proposed design is especially useful for modern communication and embedded
systems, where low power and fast processing are critical for performance optimisation.
